# Sales & Customer Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
Interactive Tableau dashboard designed to analyze **multi-year sales performance and customer behavior**, with dynamic filters for year, product, and location.

## Business Questions
- How do sales, profit, and orders change across years?
- Which product sub-categories drive profit or losses?
- How do customer purchasing patterns vary over time?
- Who are the most profitable customers by selected period?

## Tools Used
- Tableau Public
- Excel / CSV

## Key Insights
- Performance metrics vary significantly by year and region.
- Certain sub-categories consistently generate losses despite high sales.
- A small set of customers contributes disproportionately to total profit.
- Most customers place 1–2 orders, indicating repeat purchase potential.
